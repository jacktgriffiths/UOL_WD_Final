    <h1>Website Report - Jack Griffiths</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This website was put together as a magazine aimed at people who have experienced or who are interested in jaw surgery, predominantly Double Jaw Surgery. As I have personally undertaken Double Jaw Surgery in February 2020 and I had to search quote a lot to find up-to-date blogs I thought this website would be brilliant for helping people who went through what I went through. The website is structured in a way that is designed to be intuitive to the user. One example of this is that not only did I implement a header in the website to enable easy navigation, I also added hyperlinks to the images on the homepage which enable people to jump to the relevant pages with ease.</p>
    <h2>State 3 things that have inspired you when creating your website</h2>
    <p>My first inspiration for the website I slightly touched on above and that was other jaw surgery blogs that I studied and read whilst preparing for my own surgery. These, although sparse, gave me some real insight into what I was about to undertake and the experience I was going to have. The information gained really did help put me at ease prior to the surgery and helped me understand and prepare for what immediate life would be like after the surgery. Secondarily, I was really inspired by Gary Vaynerchuk’s website as I really liked its layout and intuitive nature. It is full of content and it really keeps the reader interested whilst not being too much to the point where you experience a somewhat information overload and get turned off by the website. The large opening video inspired my half page video and the theme inspired my original mock-ups of how I wanted my website to be, although I did in the end change for a lighter theme as I thought this reflected what I thought the users would prefer. Finally, I was actually really inspired by my fellow students on slack. The one really positive point I will point out in this degree so far is the other students. Any issues I had they are always there to help and they also kept me going when I was finding parts of the project difficult.</p>

    <h2>State 3 ways in which your site is accessible.</h2>
    <p>Firstly I wanted to make sure my website was fully accessible for people with disabilities so I ensured that I used accurate alt tags across the different pages to give a visually impaired person the ability to navigate and understand the basic content on the website. Additionally I added links on the index page with image representations so that someone with a difficulty reading could use these images and intuitively come to understand which page they would link to.</p>

    <h2>State 3 ways in which you have considered usability in your site.</h2>
    <p>In the first instance I implemented an easy to used and intuitive navigation bar that linked to each different page of my website, this allows easy usage and navigation throughout. This navigation bar was fixed at the top of the page so the user wouldn’t have to constantly scroll to the top in order to move to a different page. On every page, clicking on the title of the website ‘Double Jaw Surgery’ will take you back to the index and thus helps easy navigation. I have focussed on making my website fairly hyperlink heavy which I feel gives the visitor a much easier user experience whilst not feeling clunky or overdone.</p>

    <h2>State 3 things you had to learn/find out by yourself when creating your site, and describe how you did that (i.e. what searches you did, any new tools/techniques you learned, any changes/adaptations you made to a particular resource to make it work with your site).</h2>
    <p>CSS animations was a part that I wasn’t very confident with so I had to research this quite a bit further and managed to implement it quite well in my header, I do like the way this works as I feel that it’s quite clean. Even though we have been taught a lot in this course, I have never done web development before (besides WordPress) so a lot of the content I had to research and find out different ways to implement them. The implementation of JQuery was something that I researched and this came in really handy and saved me from having to hard code my header and footer across the different pages. Thirdly CSS formatting in general I found rather hard, I did have to look further into CSS to try and get the formatting I wanted and in general I think it worked quote well. I also implemented bootstrap in my navigation bar which was a really good solution because it enabled me to get used to using external CSS libraries.</p>

    <h2>What aspect(s) of your work do you think worked well and why?</h2>
    <p>I am really proud of my implementation of my navigation bar as the animation was something I really wanted to get right. I did get some help with the code from an online resource, but I adapted it for use and I really like the way it turned out. I also really think my implementation of my Blog & Types page look quite smart as the individual divs in the grid layout are clean, easy to read and link to their respective sources for further reading.</p>

    <h2>What aspect(s) of your work could be improved, and how might you do things differently another time?</h2>
    <p>If I was developing another website from scratch, I would definitely focus on using other CSS libraries much more as this development experience has really shown me how powerful libraries like Bootstrap really are. I have looked at other websites during this experience that are almost fully made with Bootstrap and possibly a very minimal amount of custom CSS and they are absolutely excellent and feel much better to use. I think this goes to show that I shouldn’t try and re-invent the wheel and understand that if the code is already out there to use, I should take full advantage of it.</p>
